# Shellcode-Injector-https
Downloading shellcode to bypass ASR

This is an updated version of the previous [Injector](https://github.com/JimSolomon/Shellcode-Injector) which hardcoded the shellcode into the injector, this updated version downloads shellcode over https. 


It benefits if the shellcode blob is too large to hardcode and security engine detects the hardcorded shellcode.
